<center><b><u>Kubernetes</u></b>    Kubernetes also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</center>
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.<br>
It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.
The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". <br>
Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed<br>
ideas and practices from the community.

<center><b><u>Docker overview</u></b>   Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your <br>
infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. <br>
By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and <br>
running it in production.

<center><b><u>Maven</u></b>Maven, a Yiddish word meaning accumulator of knowledge, began as an attempt to simplify the build processes in the Jakarta Turbine project.  <br>
There were several projects, each with their own Ant build files, that were all slightly different. JARs were checked into CVS. We wanted a standard way to build the  <br>
projects, a clear definition of what the project consisted of, an easy way to publish project information, and a way to share JARs across several projects.
The result is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project. We hope that we have created something that will make the day-to-day  <br>
work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project..
